To run the game:
- Install and run a local server (XAMPP was used during development)
- Copy the root folder (RogueLikeProject) into <xampp folder>\htdocs\
- Open browser (used Chrome for development) and enter the following URL: 
	localhost/RoguelikeProject/index.html

Notes: the GameOver state was not implemented as it made sense to include GameOver functionality within the Game state.
