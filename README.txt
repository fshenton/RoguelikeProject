To run the game:
- Install and run a local server (XAMPP was used during development)
- Copy the root folder (RogueLikeProject) into <xampp folder>\htdocs\
- Open browser (used Chrome for development) and enter the following URL: 
	localhost/RoguelikeProject/index.html

Notes: 
- I was unable to track down the original source for the website background image.
- The GameOver state was not implemented as it made sense to include GameOver functionality within the Game state.
- Some parts of the code could certainly benefit from refactoring, but they are functional and time is short.
- I have left some console.log debugging uncommented, so you can get an idea of how I was debugging during implementation (see Chrome console).
